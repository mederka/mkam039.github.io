	<h3>about</h3>
	<p>I was born in Kyrgyzstan and grew up there until I got a chance to do an undergrad at MIT, where I studied Chemistry and a little bit of writing. A PhD fellowship allowed me to work with Margaret Brimble at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. We investigated the molecular changes that happen to biological tissues as they age. Two months after getting the degree, I moved with my family to Austria and since then work as a scientist (postdoc) with Christian Becker at the University of Vienna. We are developing methods for biomimetic synthesis of silica. My overall scientific interests revolve around peptides, their physical, biological and magical properties.</p>

	<p>I also like coding, which is something I did here and there for the past five years. But in this past year I got into web development and have been dedicating increasing amounts of time to it. This allowed to me to learn a bit of Javascript, which in turn allowed me to build a couple of web projects.</p>
