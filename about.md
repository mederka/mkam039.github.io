<h3>about</h3>
<p>I was born in Kyrgyzstan and spent my school years there. I then got very lucky and got a chance to do an undergrad at MIT, where I studied Chemistry and a little bit of writing. A PhD fellowship allowed me afterwards to work with Margaret Brimble at the University of Auckland in beautiful New Zealand. We investigated the molecular changes that happen to our tissues as our bodies get old. Two months after getting the degree, I moved with my family to Austria and since then work as a scientist (postdoc) with Christian Becker at the University of Vienna. We are developing methods for biomimetic synthesis of silica. My overall scientific interests revolve around peptides, their physical, biological and magical properties.</p>

<p>I also like coding, which is something I did here and there for the past five years. But in this past year I got into web development and have been dedicating increasing amounts of time to it. This allowed to me to learn a bit of Javascript, which in turn allowed me to build a couple of web projects.</p>
