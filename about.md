<h3>about</h3>
<p>I was born in Kyrgyzstan, spent my school years there, during which I took part in High School Chemistry competitions. My undergrad happened at MIT, a place full of amazing and amazingly crazy people. It was a humbling experience. A fellowship from the Maurice Wilkins Centre has then allowed me to do a PhD with Margaret Brimble at the University of Auckland in beautiful, beautiful New Zealand. There we studied the molecular changes in our tissues that come with age. After that I moved to Austria and now work as a scientist (postdoc) with Christian Becker at the University of Vienna. My scientific interests revolve around peptides, their physical, biological and magical properties.</p>

<p>I also like coding, which is something I did here and there for the past five years. But in this past year I got really taken by web development and have been dedicating increasing amounts of time to it. This allowed to me to learn a bit of Javascript, which in turn allowed me to build a couple of web projects. It's very difficult to translate the feeling one feels, when he or she sets out to solve a little problem (such as a bookmark icon turning (and then staying) green), spends six hours trying to solve it, learns a great lot and finally makes it work. So far, for me, web development has been full of moments likes that.</p>
